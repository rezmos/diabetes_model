I decided to work with this dataset since it represents 10 years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks. The integrity of this data could help me to solve a real-world problem using Data science.

 Iâ€™ll be using Machine Learning to predict whether a patient could be:
 
1. No readmissioned;
2. A readmission in less than 30 days (this situation is not good, because maybe
your treatment was not appropriate);
3. A readmission in more than 30 days (this one is not so good as well the last
one, however, the reason could be the state of the patient.

The analisys walks through the next steps:
 1. Data Understanding
 2. Data Exploration
 3. Cleaning
 4. Training Machine Learning Model
 5. Evaluating Machine Learning Model
 
 Every single step, it's described in diabetes_jupyter.ipynb.
